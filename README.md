Our app Demeter is a mobile app which acts as an expert system using machine learning and image recognition to help farmers and growers to quickly and accurately identify plant diseases and suggest appropriate treatments. The app uses nine Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify plant diseases based on images of visibly symptomatic plant leaves for nine different plants: tomato, corn, grape, potato, apple, cherry, peach, bell pepper, and strawberry. We created the optimal CNN models through a fine-tuning process that involved training and testing around 20 different variations with different hyperparameters dealing with how deeply an image was processed. As a result, our CNNs have a high disease identification accuracy of above 97%.
We built these CNNs using TensorFlow and Python with an augmented training dataset of more than 50,000 disease-labeled plant leaf images for nine different plants. We converted the CNNs to a mobile-compatible format and size to run entirely within the mobile environment. Thus, the app does not require internet connection to function and can be taken out to the fields. Demeter strives to provide an easy-to-use interface. Users can take a photo of a plant leaf and crop it, the app then identifies the disease from the photo using the machine learning model appropriate for the plant. When the mobile app runs the model, it outputs the name of the disease with the highest confidence value, and also displays information on the causes and appropriate cures.
In addition, users can view Demeter’s comprehensive library for different plants’ growing conditions, maintenance tips, as well as their common disease symptoms, causes, and treatments. 
Since we built the app using React Native, the mobile app can run on both iOS and Android. Our use of only open source software makes the app very cost effective. Demeter is an effective and convenient tool for amatuer growers, nursery owners, and commercial farmers to get immediate plant disease diagnosis on the field.
